# Basic Netlify configuration file

[build]
  # Directory where Netlify should look for functions
  # This tells Netlify where your serverless functions are located.
  functions = "netlify/functions"

  # Optional: Directory that contains the deploy-ready HTML files and assets
  # If your index.html is in the root, you can leave this commented or set to "."
  # publish = "."

  # Optional: The command to run to build your site
  # For a simple static site with functions, this might not be needed
  # as Netlify automatically installs dependencies from the root package.json
  # and bundles functions in the specified directory.
  # command = "npm install" # Example if you needed a specific build step

[functions]
  # Explicitly set the Node.js version for functions
  # Using a recent, stable LTS version is recommended.
  # Check Netlify docs for supported versions: https://docs.netlify.com/functions/build-with-javascript/#runtime-settings
  node_bundler = "esbuild" # Use esbuild for potentially better bundling

# You can add other configurations here, like environment variables
# (though setting them in the UI is often easier for secrets)
# or redirects.
